# oer-tango-uscots-2017

Slides for the "Open Education Resources in Statistics Education" talk at USCOTS 2017.

This talk is part of the TANGO Stat Ed project, which is an NSF-funded grant to support effective statistics instruction of community college instructors. The program has a community of almost 70 instructors from four regions around the country â€“ Philadelphia, Florida, Northern California, and Southern California.  

The goal of the session is to expose instructors to Open Education Resources (OER) and discuss how they can be used as a whole or piecemeal in their instruction.
